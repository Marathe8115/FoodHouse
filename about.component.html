        Food marketing brings together the producer and the consumer. It is the chain of activities that brings food
        from "farm gate to plate". The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process
        involving many producers and companies. For example, 56 companies are involved in making one can of chicken
        noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors, but also the companies that
        transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans. The food marketing system is the
        largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.

        In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market
        day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase
        by local consumers. With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing
        industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically, early grocery
        shops would be counter-based where purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted and the shop-keeper would
        get it for them.

        In the 20th century, supermarkets were born. Supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping
        using shopping carts, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced
        staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development
        of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.[38]

        Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large companies
        control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and
        processors, and strong influence over consumers. Less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers,
        with larger percentages going to advertising, transportation, and intermediate corporations.
